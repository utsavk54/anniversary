          💖 My dearest love, Sanyukta<br><br>

          Happy 7th anniversary! Today is not just a celebration of the years we've shared, but a celebration of us —
          our love, our bond, and the bright future that lies ahead. I want you to know, from the very depths of my
          heart, that I love you more than words could ever express. 🌸✨<br><br>

          Every day with you feels like a dream — soft, beautiful, and full of warmth. The way you light up my world
          with just your smile, the way your laughter makes everything better, and the way your love surrounds me — it’s
          a feeling I never want to end. 💕<br><br>

          I am so grateful for you, for us, and for the journey that continues. I look forward to the countless days
          ahead — the quiet mornings together, the cozy evenings, the laughter that never ends, and the love that grows
          deeper with every passing moment. 🕊️💞<br><br>

          You are my heart, my home, my everything. With you, every day is brighter, every challenge lighter, and every
          dream more beautiful. I promise to keep loving you endlessly, to cherish you forever, and to walk beside you
          through everything life brings. 💖🌸<br><br>

          I can’t wait for all the adventures, the smiles, the hugs, the silly little moments, and the simple, magical
          days that are waiting for us. With you, life is full of joy, love, and endless possibilities. 💫🎀<br><br>

          Thank you for being you — so wonderfully, perfectly, beautifully you. I love you more than I can ever say, and
          I will keep loving you more with every heartbeat. 🥰❤️<br><br>

          Here’s to the future, my love, to all the happiness, laughter, and love that we will share, and to the endless
          moments that we’ll treasure together. I can’t imagine my life without you, and I never want to. 🌸💖✨<br><br>

          Forever yours, always and endlessly,<br>
          <strong>Utsav Khadka</strong> 💕💞💖
